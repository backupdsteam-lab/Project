    <h1>E1 : 20 Questions</h1>
    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p>Q: What is your favorite hobby and why?</p>
    <p>A: Creating art is my favorite hobby. I love the creative process and expressing myself through my artwork.</p>
    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>Q: If you had a third functioning ear, where would you put it and why?</p>
    <p>A: I would put the third ear on the back of my neck so I can hear whats going on behind me. I feel like it would heighten my senses.</p>
    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <p>Q: Which element (Earth, Fire, Water, or Air) do you believe is the strongest and why?</p>
    <p>A: I think earth or fire are the strongest elements. Fire because it doesnt take much for a flame to start and spread. And Earth because it is more just rock. There are a lot of scary natural disasters.</p>
    <h2>Question 4</h2>
    <p>Q: If you had to pick a song that would best describe you, what would it be and why?</p>
    <p>A:The Hills by Rachel Chinouriri. I feel like it perfectly describes me because I relate to it a lot. That feeling restlessness and unable to fit in the past and present. And that feeling of being not where youre supoose to be.</p>
    <h2>Question 5</h2>
    <p>Q: How would you describe your favorite movie?</p>
    <p>A: My favorite movie is Romeo + Juliet (1996). I would say it is a modern spin on the story of Juliet and her Romeo but while tying in old english. The cinematography feels so different from the first hour of the film and the second, I love that it feels like a play. Plus the music is so good.</p>
    <h2>Question 6</h2>
    <p>Q: What is your earliest memory?</p>
    <p>A: Being in daycare in germany when I was 3 or 4. Its patchy but I do remember it.</p>
    <h2>Question 7:</h2>
    <p>Q: What is your ideal way to spend the weekend?</p>

    <h2>Question 8:</h2>
    <p>Q: What scent would you say brings back a childhood memory?</p>

    <p>Q: What would you have in your ideal happy place and why?</p>

    <h2>Question 11</h2>
    <p>Q: What movie did you see that left an impact on you in life and why?</p>

    <h2>Question 14</h2>
    <p>Q: If you could be any villain or hero based on power who would you be and why?</p>

    <h2>Question 15</h2>
    <p>Q: If you would like to try many different foods around the world, which one would you pick and why?</p>

    <h2>Question 16</h2>
    <p>Q: If you could have a discussion with anybody from history, who would you pick and why?</p>
